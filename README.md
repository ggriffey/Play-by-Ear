# Play-by-Ear

Play By Ear is a web app that utilizes the Web MIDI API to help musicians become more comfortable playing by ear. 

The app is build with node/express on the backend, and incorporates the popular music/audio npm library Tone.js (https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js).

Currently in development, the app aims to allow users to record and submit their own melodies through clicking on a virtual piano keyboard or by connecting a MIDI device and playing the melody through that, straight onto the webpage. Users can test their ear training by having the app play a melody for them and ask them to play it back with only the starting pitch given. In the future, the app will store data on the types of success/mistakes the user makes, tailoring specific feedback to that user in hopes of making their practice sessions more effective.
